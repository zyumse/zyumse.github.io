I am now a Postdoc in the department of chemistry at University of Illinois at Urbana Champagin. I obtained a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison in 2022. I am working on combining physics-based methods and machine learning techniques to model and understand materials, particularly focusing on glasses and polymer networks.
